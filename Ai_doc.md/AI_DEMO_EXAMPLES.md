```

## 2. 🔄 Story Continuation

### Example: Continuing a Mystery Story

**Your Story So Far:**
```
Detective Sarah Chen stared at the photograph. The victim's last known location was the abandoned warehouse on Fifth Street. But something didn't add up. Why would a successful lawyer be in that part of town at midnight?
```

**AI Continuation (Tone: Mysterious):**
```
She traced the edge of the photo with her finger, noticing a detail she'd missed before—a reflection in the warehouse window. Someone had been watching. The realization sent a chill down her spine. This wasn't a random crime; it was carefully orchestrated. But by whom, and more importantly, why?

Sarah grabbed her coat and headed for the door. If her hunch was correct, the answers lay not in the warehouse itself, but in the building across the street. The one with the perfect vantage point.
```

## 3. 💡 Creative Suggestions

### Example: Plot Twist Ideas

**Your Story:**
```
A young woman discovers she can see ghosts. She starts helping them find peace. One ghost, an old man, asks her to deliver a message to his daughter.
```

**AI Suggestions (Type: Plot):**

1. **The Daughter Is Already Dead** - Plot twist: When she goes to deliver the message, she discovers the daughter died years ago and is actually another ghost she's been helping all along, but neither knew their connection.

2. **The Message Reveals Her Own Past** - The message contains information that reveals the protagonist's own forgotten childhood, showing she was involved in the old man's death accidentally as a child, and her power is actually a manifestation of suppressed guilt.

3. **The Old Man Is Not What He Seems** - The "ghost" is actually a powerful entity testing her abilities, and delivering the message will either trap her in the ghost world forever or give her the power to free all trapped souls—she must choose.

"Hi," John said, his voice betraying the nervousness he felt.
"Oh. Hi," Mary replied, surprised to see him after all these years.
"How have you been?" His words hung in the air between them, weighted with unspoken questions.
"Better than I expected," she answered, meeting his eyes for the first time. "And worse than I hoped."
```

2. **Show Character Through Speech Patterns:**

"Hey," John mumbled, scuffing his shoe against the pavement.
"Well, well. John Miller." Mary's tone dripped with practiced indifference.

```

3. **Add Action Between Dialogue:**

John spotted her across the coffee shop. "Hi," he called out, immediately regretting how desperate he sounded.

She stirred her coffee, watching the cream swirl. "Good." The word came out flat, final.

## 7. 🎭 Tone Variations (Continue Story)

**Starting Story:**
```
The spaceship's alarms blared. Captain Rodriguez checked the radar—an unknown object was approaching fast.
```

**Continuation - Dramatic Tone:**
```
"All hands to battle stations!" Rodriguez's voice boomed through the intercom. The unknown object's approach was too calculated to be random. Her years of experience screamed one truth: they were being hunted. The crew scrambled to their positions as the red warning lights painted their faces in ominous shadows. Whatever was coming, they had mere minutes to prepare. And failure wasn't an option.
```

**Continuation - Action Tone:**
```
Rodriguez slammed her fist on the console. "Evasive maneuvers, now!" The ship lurched hard to port as the weapons officer locked onto the target. "Fire!" Energy beams lit up the void as the unknown craft dodged with impossible agility. "Again!" Rodriguez barked. This was going to be a fight.
```

**Continuation - Horror Tone:**
```
The lights flickered. Then died. Rodriguez's blood ran cold as the radar screen went blank—all except for one thing. The object wasn't approaching anymore. It was already here. A metallic scraping echoed through the hull, slow and deliberate, as if whatever was out there was savoring their fear. Someone screamed in the cargo bay. Then the scream cut off.
```
